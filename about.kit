        <h2 class="text-centered">Our Story</h2>
        <p class="text-centered">The first Eat The Street was held in 2011 in a small parking lot on Kapiolani Blvd. With a turn out of over 1,500 people, many vendors sold out…sparking an idea that caught fire. After the first event, Street Grindz partnered with Kamehameha Schools to move Eat The Street to the 555 South street lot in Kaka’ako which has been the home of Eat The Street until March of 2015. 6 years running, Eat The Street is now located at Kaka’ako Park – 747 Ala Moana Blvd. and features over 40 food vendors each month and attracts over 7,000 people eager to sample the best street food Hawaii has to offer!</p>
